    <h3>Types of cookies</h3>

    <p>
      The cookies used by our websites may be placed on your computer or mobile
      device by our website (“first party cookies”) or by third parties whose
      services we use as part of the website (“third party cookies”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cookies are temporary, and only last until you close your web browser
      (“session cookies”), while others will stay on your computer or mobile
      device even after your browser session has ended (“persistent cookies”).
    </p>
    <p>We use the following four categories of cookies on our websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> These cookies are necessary
        for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
        They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which
        amount to a request for services, such as logging in, registering for
        classes, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert
        you about these cookies, but if you do this some parts of the site may
        not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preferences cookies.</strong> Also known as “functional
        cookies,” these cookies allow the website to remember choices you have
        made in the past, like what language you prefer, what region you would
        like weather reports for, or what your user name and password are so you
        can automatically log in. They may also be used to provide services you
        have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. If you
        do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not
        function properly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance cookies.</strong> These cookies allow us to count
        visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance
        of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least
        popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these
        cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not
        allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and
        will not be able to monitor its performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Social Media Cookies.</strong> These cookies are set by a range
        of social media services to enable you to share our content with your
        friends and networks. They are capable of tracking your browser across
        other sites and building up a profile of your interests. This may impact
        the content and messages you see on other websites you visit. If you do
        not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see these sharing
        tools.
      </li>
    </ul>

      We may update this statement from time to time in order to reflect, for
